<objective>
Create the inventory display, trait list, and mid-conflict trait invocation system so players can see and use their character's belongings and traits during gameplay.

Purpose: Items and traits are what make each Dog unique. Trait invocation mid-conflict is the signature DitV mechanic where players narrate their traits into the fiction for bonus dice. This plan makes the character's assets interactive and mechanically meaningful.

Output: Inventory panel, trait list, trait invocation UI integrated into conflict flow, item dice contribution.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Inventory and trait display components</name>
  <files>src/components/Character/InventoryPanel.tsx, src/components/Character/TraitList.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create `src/components/Character/InventoryPanel.tsx`:
    - Props: items: Item[]
    - Display each item as a row: name, category badge, dice notation, gun indicator
    - Category badges use Tailwind colors: normal=gray, big=blue, excellent=green, big-excellent=emerald, crap=red
    - Gun items show a small bullet/target icon (from Lucide: Target or Crosshair)
    - Dice shown as small colored icons inline (reuse die color scheme)
    - Empty state: "No items" message
    - Add data-testid="inventory-panel" and data-testid="item-{id}" per item

    Create `src/components/Character/TraitList.tsx`:
    - Props: traits: Trait[], onInvoke?: (traitId: string) => void, usedTraitIds?: Set<string>
    - Display each trait: name, dice notation (e.g., "2d6"), source badge (creation=amber, fallout=red)
    - If onInvoke provided (conflict mode): show "Invoke" button next to each trait
    - If trait id is in usedTraitIds: show "Used" badge instead of invoke button, dim the row
    - Without onInvoke (passive display): just show traits as info
    - Add data-testid="trait-list" and data-testid="trait-{id}" per trait
    - Add data-testid="invoke-trait-{id}" on invoke buttons
  </action>
  <verify>`npm run build` succeeds. Components render correctly with test data.</verify>
  <done>InventoryPanel shows items with categories and dice. TraitList shows traits with invoke capability.</done>
</task>

  <name>Task 2: Trait invocation during conflict and item dice</name>
  <files>src/components/Character/TraitInvocation.tsx, src/types/conflict.ts, src/reducers/conflictReducer.ts, src/components/Conflict/ConflictView.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Update `src/types/conflict.ts`:
    - Add `usedTraits: string[]` to the ACTIVE phase of ConflictState (track invoked trait IDs)
    - Add `usedItems: string[]` to the ACTIVE phase (track used item IDs)
    - Add new ConflictAction:
      - { type: 'INVOKE_TRAIT'; traitId: string; dice: Die[] } — adds rolled trait dice to player pool
      - { type: 'USE_ITEM'; itemId: string; dice: Die[] } — adds rolled item dice to player pool
    - Initialize usedTraits: [] and usedItems: [] in START_CONFLICT

    Update `src/reducers/conflictReducer.ts`:
    - Handle INVOKE_TRAIT:
      - Guard: only valid when phase is ACTIVE and currentTurn is PLAYER_RAISE or PLAYER_SEE
      - Guard: traitId must NOT be in usedTraits array
      - Add traitId to usedTraits array
      - Add dice (already rolled by component) to playerPool
    - Handle USE_ITEM:
      - Guard: only valid when phase is ACTIVE and currentTurn is PLAYER_RAISE or PLAYER_SEE
      - Guard: itemId must NOT be in usedItems array
      - Add itemId to usedItems array
      - Add dice to playerPool

    Create `src/components/Character/TraitInvocation.tsx`:
    - Props: none (uses useCharacter and conflict state)
    - Shows available traits from character that haven't been used this conflict
    - Each trait shows: name, dice it would add, "Invoke" button
    - Also shows usable items (inventory items not yet used this conflict)
    - On invoke: rolls the trait/item dice (using rollDie from utils), dispatches INVOKE_TRAIT/USE_ITEM with rolled dice
    - Used traits/items shown as dimmed with "Used" badge
    - Collapsible panel that slides in from side (framer-motion)
    - Add data-testid="trait-invocation-panel"

    Update `src/components/Conflict/ConflictView.tsx`:
    - Import TraitInvocation
    - Render TraitInvocation component when conflict is ACTIVE and currentTurn is PLAYER_RAISE or PLAYER_SEE
    - Position it as a side panel or overlay that doesn't block the main raise/see controls
    - Only show if character has traits or items to invoke
  </action>
  <verify>`npm run build` succeeds. During conflict, player can invoke traits to add dice to pool. Each trait usable only once per conflict.</verify>
  <done>Traits invoke mid-conflict adding dice to player pool. Items contribute dice when used. Each usable only once per conflict. Invocation UI appears during player's raise/see turns.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- `npm run build` succeeds
- Inventory panel displays items with categories and dice
- Trait list shows traits with dice and source
- During conflict: trait invocation panel appears on player's turn
- Invoking a trait adds its dice to player pool
- Same trait cannot be invoked twice in same conflict
- Items can contribute dice once per conflict
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Inventory displays all items (coat, gun, Book of Life, sacred earth) with correct dice
- Traits display with source badges (creation vs fallout)
- Mid-conflict invocation works: select trait -> dice added to pool
- One-use-per-conflict rule enforced (used traits dimmed)
- Items also usable in conflicts with same one-use rule
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-character-system/04-03-SUMMARY.md`
